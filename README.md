# üìö Laravel Book Dashboard

A dynamic Laravel-powered dashboard for browsing and analyzing book data with user-submitted reviews. This project demonstrates advanced Eloquent usage, query scopes, and a responsive UI for filtering content from a relational MySQL database.

- üß† **Scoped Queries**: Custom Eloquent query scopes like `popularLastMonth()`, `highestRatedLast6Months()` for reusable, expressive database queries.
- ‚ö° **Optimized Queries**: Uses subqueries via `withCount` and `withAvg` to avoid N+1 problems and keep performance high.
